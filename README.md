# FNIRs
This project aims to create a FNIRs device that will connect directly to the TDT. The current circuit boards in this repository include as follows:
Detector: This board includes a photodiode sensor, and an amplifier.
Emitter: This board contains 3 different LED types, one is IR, one is red, and one is a bicolor LED with both IR and red light. This board is for testing to see which LED or LED combination we should use.
Port: This will plug into the TDT Subject Interface Module.
